      <description>Ah, coding. Love it or hate it, it’s an essential tool in many biologists’ repertoire. Going into college, I had no idea that there would be so much coding and computer work involved. In fact, if you had shown freshman year me one of my latest projects, I would have run in the other direction!

Throughout high school, I was infamous among my family and friends for being hopelessly lost when working with computers.</description>
