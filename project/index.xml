      <description>IntroductionThe data that I am using for this project comes from the Primate Molecular Ecology and Evolution Lab, with permission for use from Dr. Anthony Di Fiore. This data documents information about monkeys that were tranquilized at the Tiputini Biodiversity Station to take biological samples and place a tracking collar on the animal. There are 21 observations, meaning that there were a total of 21 monkeys darted. The columns included in this dataset are as follows:</description>

      <description>Mexican Waterfowl Count Data Across Two Two-Year Periods from iNaturalistFor my project, I am using data exported from iNaturalist, one of the largest platforms for citizen science. This data is interesting to me becuase citizen science platforms such as iNaturalist have recently been recognized for their valuable potential for science. Mobilizing every day people to collect data on the natural world has provided scientists with an unprecedented ability to monitor biodiversity on different spatial scales.</description>

      <description>This paper was my final term paper for Field Herpetology. In it, I review existing scientific knowledge of the salamanders of central texas (genus Eurycea), how these species are affected by urbanization, and the policies in place concerning their protection. As someone who spent most of my childhood in Central Texas, this issue is near and dear to me. Read on to find out more about one of the most unique animal groups of this region!</description>
