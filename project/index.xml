      <description>IntroductionThe data that I am using for this project comes from the Primate Molecular Ecology and Evolution Lab, with permission for use from Dr. Anthony Di Fiore. This data documents information about monkeys that were tranquilized at the Tiputini Biodiversity Station to take biological samples and place a tracking collar on the animal.

This data is interesting to me becuase citizen science platforms such as iNaturalist have recently been recognized for their valuable potential for science. Mobilizing every day people to collect data on the natural world has provided scientists with an unprecedented ability to monitor biodiversity on different spatial scales.</description>
